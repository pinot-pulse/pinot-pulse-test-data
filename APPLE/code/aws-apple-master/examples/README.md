# AWS@Apple examples

This directory contains some examples for common uses cases at AWS@Apple and are intended to be used as a reference for users writing their own stacks.

Each directory includes an specific use case and can be visited in any order. However we recommend new users to visit the [Getting Started Guide](https://aws.apple.com/getting-started/) first where the basic building blocks are explained one by one in separate lessons.
